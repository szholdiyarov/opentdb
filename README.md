This is simple api fetcher application.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with expo init.

## To run this app

First,
### `npm install`

And then:

### `expo start`

OR simply go to this link https://expo.io/@szholdiyarov/opentdb

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
